A set of modules you can use to intercept traffic at the packet, TCP or HTTP/HTTPS level while performing a [MITM attack](/modules/ethernet/spoofers/introduction/).
Each proxy can be either extended with the Go plugin system (when keeping high performances is important), or scripted with Javascript plugins thanks to the [Otto builtin engine](https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto).
