The easiest way to use bettercap is through the official **[web UI](https://github.com/bettercap/ui)**.

First, install the [latest version of bettercap](https://github.com/bettercap/bettercap/releases). Then run:

```bash
sudo bettercap -eval "ui on"
```

You can customize the UI (and REST API) settings, use `help ui` and `help api.rest` for more.
