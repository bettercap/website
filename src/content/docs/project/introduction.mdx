## Overview

**bettercap** is a powerful, extensible framework written in Go.
It offers security researchers, red teamers, and reverse engineers an **all-in-one solution**.

Perform reconnaissance and attacks on:
- [WiFi](/modules/wifi/) networks
- [Bluetooth Low Energy](/modules/ble/) devices
- Wireless [HID](/modules/hid/) devices
- [CAN-bus](/modules/canbus/)
- [IPv4/IPv6](/modules/ethernet/netprobe) networks

## Main Features

- **WiFi** networks scanning, [deauthentication attack](https://www.evilsocket.net/2018/07/28/Project-PITA-Writeup-build-a-mini-mass-deauther-using-bettercap-and-a-Raspberry-Pi-Zero-W/), [clientless PMKID association attack](https://www.evilsocket.net/2019/02/13/Pwning-WiFi-networks-with-bettercap-and-the-PMKID-client-less-attack/) and automatic WPA/WPA2 client handshakes capture.
- **Bluetooth Low Energy** devices scanning, characteristics enumeration, reading and writing.
- 2.4Ghz wireless devices scanning and **MouseJacking** attacks with over-the-air HID frames injection (with DuckyScript support).
- Passive and active IP network hosts probing and recon.
- **ARP, DNS, DHCPv6 and NDP spoofers** for MITM attacks on IPv4 and IPv6 based networks.
- **Proxies at packet level, TCP level and HTTP/HTTPS** application level fully scriptable with easy to implement **javascript plugins**.
- A powerful **network sniffer** for **credentials harvesting** which can also be used as a **network protocol fuzzer**.
- A very fast port scanner.
- CAN-bus support for reading, injecting, **fuzzing**, loading custom DBC and builtin OBD2 PIDs parser.
- A powerful [REST API](/modules/core/apirest/) with support for asynchronous events notification on websocket to orchestrate your attacks easily.
- An easy to use [web user interface](/usage/web_ui).
- More!

## About the 1.x Legacy Version

The first version (up to 1.6.2) was implemented in Ruby.
It only offered basic MITM, sniffing, and proxying capabilities.
Version 2.x is a complete reimplementation using [Go](https://golang.org/).

This ground-up rewrite offered several advantages:

- **Single binary** distribution with minimal dependencies for **any OS and architecture**
- 1.x proxies [bottlenecked the network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock) during MITM attacks. The new version adds almost **no overhead**.
- Previous **performance limitations** made many 2.x features impossible to implement properly.

**Versions prior to 2.x are deprecated**.
Support has been dropped in favor of the new implementation.

An archived copy of the legacy documentation is [available here](/legacy/).
**Upgrading is strongly recommended**.
