This module is responsible for periodically reading the system ARP table in order to detect new hosts on the network.

### Commands

#### `net.recon on`

Start network hosts discovery.

#### `net.recon off`

Stop network hosts discovery.

#### `net.clear`

Clear all endpoints collected by the hosts discovery module.

#### `net.show`

Show cache hosts list (default sorting by ip).

#### `net.show ADDRESS1, ADDRESS2`

Show information about a specific list of addresses (by IP or MAC).

#### `net.show.meta ADDRESS1, ADDRESS2`

Show metadata (mDNS, UPnP, open ports, etc) about a specific list of addresses (by IP or MAC).

### Parameters

| Parameter         | Default  | Description                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `net.show.meta`   | `false`  | If true, the net.show command will show all metadata collected about each endpoint.                         |
| `net.show.filter` |          | Defines a regular expression filter for `net.show`.                                                         |
| `net.show.sort`   | `ip asc` | Defines sorting field (`ip`, `mac`, `seen`, `sent`, `rcvd`) and direction (`asc` or `desc`) for `net.show`. |
| `net.show.limit`  | `0`      | If greater than zero, defines limit for `net.show`.                                                         |

### Examples

Sort by IP and filter for MAC addresses starting with `B8`:

```
> set net.show.sort ip asc
> set net.show.filter ^B8
> net.show
```

Filter by endpoints with the string `Apple` in their hostname or vendor fields:

```
> set net.show.filter Apple
> net.show
```

Show top 10 endpoints sorted by last activity timestamp:

```
> set net.show.sort seen desc
> set net.show.limit 10
> net.show
```
