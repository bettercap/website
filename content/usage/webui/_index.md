![UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bettercap/media/master/ui-events.png)

The easiest way to start playing with bettercap is using its official [web user interface](https://github.com/bettercap/ui), in order to install it make sure you have the [latest version of bettercap](https://github.com/bettercap/bettercap/releases), then:

```sh
sudo bettercap -eval "ui on"
```

You can customize the UI (and REST API) settings, use `help ui` and `help api.rest` for more.
