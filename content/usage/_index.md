bettercap can be used in three different ways:

- [Web UI](/usage/webui/) - the easiest method, good if you never used bettercap before.
- [Interactive Mode](/usage/interactive/) - an interactive session on terminal that will unlock more advanced features.
- [Scripting](/usage/scripting/) - using the builtin javascript engine with agents that automate the session.
