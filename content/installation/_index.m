**bettercap supports GNU/Linux, BSD, Android, Apple macOS and the Microsoft Windows** operating systems - depending if you want to install the latest stable release or the bleeding edge from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bettercap/bettercap), you have several choices.

## Precompiled Binaries

For every new release, we distribute bettercap's [precompiled binaries](https://github.com/bettercap/bettercap/releases). In order to be able to use them, you'll need the following dependencies on your system:

* libpcap
* libusb-1.0-0 (required by the [HID module](/modules/hid/))
* libnetfilter-queue (on Linux only, required by the [packet.proxy module](/modules/ethernet/proxies/packet.proxy/))

## Using Docker

BetterCAP is containerized using [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) -  a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based on musl libc and busybox. The resulting Docker image is relatively small and easy to manage the dependencies. Since it is using a multi-stage build, **a Docker version greater than 17.05 is required**.

To pull latest stable version of the image:

    docker pull bettercap/bettercap

To pull latest source code build of the image:

    docker pull bettercap/dev

To run:

    docker run -it --privileged --net=host bettercap/bettercap -h

## Compiling from Sources

In order to compile bettercap from sources, make sure that:

* You have a correctly configured **[Go >= 1.8](https://golang.org/doc/install)** environment.
* `$GOPATH` is defined and `$GOPATH/bin` is in `$PATH`.
* For hardware with limited resources (like Raspberry Pi Zero boards) you might want [to increase the swap size](https://www.bitpi.co/2015/02/11/how-to-change-raspberry-pis-swapfile-size-on-rasbian/).

You'll also need to install the dependencies:

* build-essential
* libpcap-dev
* libusb-1.0-0-dev (required by the [HID module](/modules/hid/))
* libnetfilter-queue-dev (on Linux only, required by the [packet.proxy module](/modules/ethernet/proxies/packet.proxy/))

Once you've met this conditions, you can run the following commands to compile and install bettercap in `/usr/local/bin/bettercap`:

    go get github.com/bettercap/bettercap
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/bettercap/bettercap
    make build
    sudo make install

### Compiling on Android

#### Termux Method

{{% notice warning %}}
This procedure and bettercap itself require a rooted device.
{{% /notice %}}

Install [Termux](https://termux.com/) and from its prompt type:

```
pkg install root-repo
pkg install golang git libpcap libusb
```

There's a [golang bug](https://github.com/bettercap/bettercap/issues/486) in termux about some hardcoded path, the fix is ugly but it works:

```sh
sudo su
mount -o rw,remount /
mkdir -p /home/builder/.termux-build/_cache/18-arm-21-v2/bin/
ln -s `which pkg-config` /home/builder/.termux-build/_cache/18-arm-21-v2/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-pkg-config
```

#### Linux Deploy Method Debian based (like Ubuntu)

Install [Linux Deploy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.meefik.linuxdeploy), [JuiceSSH](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonelli.juicessh), in Linux Deploy install kalilinux_arm (u need the [piggy helper](https://www.google.cl/search?q=piggy+helper+apk) and enable the SSH) and type:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install golang git build-essential libpcap-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libnetfilter-queue-dev

```

You can now proceed with the compilation:

```sh
go get -u github.com/bettercap/bettercap
```

Once the build process is concluded, the binary will be located in `go/bin/bettercap`.


#### Linux Deploy Method Fedora based (like Redhat, Centos)
```
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install golang git make automake gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel libpcap-devel libusb-devel libnetfilter_queue-devel

```
