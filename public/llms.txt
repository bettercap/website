# BetterCAP

> BetterCAP is the Swiss Army knife for WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy, wireless HID hijacking, CAN-bus and IPv4/IPv6 network reconnaissance and MITM attacks. It is a powerful, easily extensible and portable framework written in Go.

BetterCAP provides security researchers, red teamers and reverse engineers with an easy to use, all-in-one solution for performing reconnaissance and attacks on various wireless and network protocols. The tool supports WiFi network scanning, deauthentication attacks, and automatic WPA/WPA2 handshake capture. It includes Bluetooth Low Energy device scanning with characteristics enumeration, reading and writing capabilities. For 2.4GHz wireless devices, it supports MouseJacking attacks with over-the-air HID frame injection using DuckyScript.

Network capabilities include passive and active IP host probing, ARP/DNS/DHCPv6/NDP spoofers for MITM attacks on IPv4 and IPv6 networks, proxies at packet, TCP and HTTP/HTTPS levels with JavaScript plugin support, a network sniffer for credential harvesting and protocol fuzzing, and a fast port scanner.

BetterCAP also provides CAN-bus support for reading, injecting, fuzzing, and OBD2 parsing. It features a REST API with websocket event notifications and an easy to use web user interface.
