	"content": "bettercap is a powerful, easily extensible and portable framework written in Go which aims to offer to security researchers, red teamers and reverse engineers an easy to use, all-in-one solution with all the features they might possibly need for performing reconnaissance and attacking WiFi networks, Bluetooth Low Energy devices, wireless HID devices and IPv4/IPv6 networks.\nMain Features  WiFi networks scanning, deauthentication attack, clientless PMKID association attack and automatic WPA/WPA2 client handshakes capture. Bluetooth Low Energy devices scanning, characteristics enumeration, reading and writing. 2.4Ghz wireless devices scanning and MouseJacking attacks with over-the-air HID frames injection (with DuckyScript support). Passive and active IP network hosts probing and recon. ARP, DNS, DHCPv6 and NDP spoofers for MITM attacks on IPv4 and IPv6 based networks. Proxies at packet level, TCP level and HTTP/HTTPS application level fully scriptable with easy to implement javascript plugins. A powerful network sniffer for credentials harvesting which can also be used as a network protocol fuzzer. A very fast port scanner. A powerful REST API with support for asynchronous events notification on websocket to orchestrate your attacks easily. An easy to use web user interface. More!   @evilsocket bettercap has done to the networking and wireless world what @metasploit did for the exploitation world. I can\u0026#39;t recommend a better tool. Long live bettercap and long live go.\n\u0026mdash; Jack Zimmer (@Zimmer_Security) 13 febbraio 2019  About the 1.x Legacy Version While the first version (up to 1.6.2) of bettercap was implemented in Ruby and only offered basic MITM, sniffing and proxying capabilities, the 2.x is a complete reimplementation using the Go programming language.\nThis ground-up rewrite offered several advantages:\n bettercap can now be distributed as a single binary with very few dependencies, for basically any OS and any architecture. 1.x proxies, altough highly optimized and event based, used to bottleneck the entire network when performing a MITM attack, while the new version adds almost no overhead. Due to such performance and functional limitations, most of the features that the 2.x version is offering were simply impossible to implement properly (read as: without killing the entire network \u0026hellip; or your computer).  For this reason, any version prior to 2.x is considered deprecated and any type of support has been dropped in favor of the new implementation. An archived copy of the legacy documentation is available here, however it is strongly suggested to upgrade.\n"

	"content": "Once started the tool with sudo bettercap (click here for the list of command line arguments), you\u0026rsquo;ll be presented with an interactive session a la Metasploit where you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to run commands, enable or disable modules, get or set parameters and so on.\nEach command can either be executed singularly, or concatenated by the ; operator, for instance, instead of typing:  clear net.show  You can simply type:  clear; net.show\n Functionalities are organized in core commands (basic commands you\u0026rsquo;ll need to perform operations such as setting a session parameter, getting its value, clearing the screen, etc) and session modules (each will provide a set of feature specific sub commands and use some session parameters for its configuration).\nCaplets Other than executing commands manually one by one, it is possible to script your interactive session using caplets. Caplets (script files with a .cap extension) are a powerful way to automate your workflow: think about them as the Metasploit\u0026rsquo;s .rc files, where each line of the file is a command that\u0026rsquo;ll be executed at runtime.\nFor instance, a simple caplet that sets the ticker.commands parameter and enables the net.probe and ticker modules would be:\nset ticker.commands 'clear; net.show; events.show 10' net.probe on ticker on  Once saved as an example.cap file, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to load and execute it via:\nsudo bettercap -caplet /path/to/example.cap  It is also possible to load a caplet by name, without its path and extension:\nsudo bettercap -caplet example  In this case the search order will be:\n ./example.cap ./caplets/example.cap Any folder in the environment variable $CAPSPATH (values are separated by :, like for $PATH). /usr/local/share/bettercap/caplets/example.cap (the default path where caplets are installed).  You can install (or update) the predefined caplets (hosted in this repository) by using the caplet module, either from the command line:\nsudo bettercap -eval \u0026quot;caplets.update; q\u0026quot;  Or simply from the interactive session:\n\u0026gt; caplets.update  You can then check what\u0026rsquo;s been installed in /usr/local/share/bettercap/caplets/ with the command:\n\u0026gt; caplets.show  Command Line Arguments The basic command line arguments ( bettercap -h ) are:\n-autostart MODULES A comma separated list of modules that are automatically started (default to events.stream).\n-caplet FILENAME Read commands from this file and execute them in the interactive session.\n-caplets-path PATH Specify an alternative base path for caplets.\n-eval COMMANDS Run one or more commands separated by ; in the interactive session, used to set variables via command line.\n-script FILENAME Load a session script.\n-iface INTERFACE Network interface to bind to, if empty the default interface will be auto selected (accepts interface name, ip or mac address)\n-gateway-override ADDRESS Use the provided IP address instead of the default gateway. If not specified or invalid, the default gateway will be auto detected and used.\n-no-history Disable the interactive session history file ~/.bettercap.history.\n-no-colors Disable terminal colors and effects.\n-env-file FILENAME Preload the parameters values from this file if found, set to empty to disable environment persistance (default ~/bettercap.env).\n-silent Suppress all logs which are not errors.\n-cpu-profile FILENAME Write a CPU profile file when exiting (used for debugging and benchmarking).\n-mem-profile FILENAME Write memory profile file when exiting (used for debugging and benchmarking).\n-debug Enable debug messages (must be used to report bugs).\n-version Print version and build information, then exit (must be used to report bugs).\nCore Commands help Will list all available commands and print the name of each module and its status (running or not running).\nhelp MODULE_NAME Will print the module specific help menu, with its sub commands and parameters.\nactive Show which modules are running and their parameters.\nquit or q Close the session and exit.\nsleep SECONDS Sleep for the given amount of seconds.\nget PARAMETER Get the value of the specified parameter, use * for all.\nset PARAMETER VALUE Set the value of PARAMETER to VALUE, use \u0026quot;\u0026quot; or '' to clear its contents.\nread PARAMETER PROMPT Show a PROMPT to ask the user for input that will be saved inside PARAMETER.\nclear Clear the screen.\ninclude CAPLET Load and run this caplet in the current session, the same behaviour can be achieved by just specifying the caplet name as a command.\n!COMMAND Execute a shell command and print its output into the session.\nalias MAC NAME Assign an alias to a given endpoint given its MAC address (will be persistent on ~/bettercap.aliases).\nBeing persisted on disk, aliases are shared across each module and bettercap session. This means that if you set an alias for a computer while on the same network, the same alias will be shown and used, for instance, by the WiFi modules when resolving wireless stations BSSID (you\u0026rsquo;ll see who\u0026rsquo;s connecting to what).\n Customizing the Prompt The interactive session prompt can be modified by setting the $ variable, for instance this:\nset $ something  Will set the prompt to the string something. You can also access parameters and use colors/effects by using the proper syntax and operators as you can see from the $ parameter default value:\n\u0026gt; get $ {by}{fw}{cidr} {fb}\u0026gt; {env.iface.ipv4} {reset} {bold}» {reset}  The available effects are:\n   Operator Description     {bold} Set text to bold.   {dim} Set dim effect on text.   {r} Set text foreground color to red.   {g} Set text foreground color to green.   {b} Set text foreground color to blue.   {y} Set text foreground color to yellow.   {fb} Set text foreground color to black.   {fw} Set text foreground color to white.   {bdg} Set text background color to dark gray.   {br} Set text background color to red.   {bg} Set text background color to green.   {by} Set text background color to yellow.   {blb} Set text background color to light blue.   {reset} Reset text effects (added by default at the end of the prompt if not specified).    There are also other operators you can use in order to access specific information about the session.\n   Operator Description     {cidr} Selected interface subnet CIDR.   {net.sent} Number of bytes being sent by the tool on the network.   {net.sent.human} Number of bytes being sent by the tool on the network (human readable form).   {net.errors} Number of errors while sending packets.   {net.received} Number of bytes being sniffed from the tool on the network.   {net.received.human} Number of bytes being sniffed from the tool from the network (human readable form).   {net.packets} Number of packets being sniffed by the tool from the network.    And finally, you can access and use any variable that has been declared in the interactive session using the {env.NAME-OF-THE-VAR} operator, for instance, the default prompt is using {env.iface.ipv4} that is replaced by the iface.ipv4 session variable contents ( you can check it using the get iface.ipv4 command ).\nExamples Set the arp.spoof.targets parameter and enable the arp.spoof module:\nsudo bettercap -eval \u0026#34;set arp.spoof.targets 192.168.1.20; arp.spoof on\u0026#34; To quickly get the help menu of a module and quit bettercap (basically like a man command), you can use the -eval argument, for example:\nsudo bettercap -eval \u0026#34;help net.recon; q\u0026#34; Ask the user to fill the arp.spoof.targets parameter:\n\u0026gt; read arp.spoof.targets \u0026quot;Select the target to spoof: \u0026quot; Set the alias \u0026ldquo;MY IPAD\u0026rdquo; to the device with MAC address DE:AD:DE:AD:BE:EF:\n\u0026gt; alias DE:AD:DE:AD:BE:EF MY IPAD "

	"content": "Spoofing modules used to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks:\n arp.spoof     dns.spoof     dhcp6.spoof     ndp.spoof (IPv6)     What is a MITM Attack? According to Wikipedia:\n In cryptography and computer security, a man-in-the-middle attack (often abbreviated to MITM, MitM, MIM, MiM attack or MITMA) is an attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. Man-in-the-middle attacks can be thought about through a chess analogy. Mallory, who barely knows how to play chess, claims that she can play two grandmasters simultaneously and either win one game or draw both. She waits for the first grandmaster to make a move and then makes this same move against the second grandmaster. When the second grandmaster responds, Mallory makes the same play against the first. She plays the entire game this way and cannot lose. A man-in-the-middle attack is a similar strategy and can be used against many cryptographic protocols. One example of man-in-the-middle attacks is active eavesdropping, in which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages between them to make them believe they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker. The attacker must be able to intercept all relevant messages passing between the two victims and inject new ones. This is straightforward in many circumstances; for example, an attacker within reception range of an unencrypted Wi-Fi wireless access point, can insert himself as a man-in-the-middle.\n This is quite a generic description, mostly because ( if we\u0026rsquo;re talking about network MITM attacks ), the logic and details heavily rely on the technique being used ( more in the spoofing section ).\nNevertheless we can simplify the concept with an example. When you connect to some network ( your home network, some public WiFi, StarBucks, etc ), the router/switch is responsible for forwarding all of your packets to the correct destination, during a MITM attack we \u0026ldquo;force\u0026rdquo; the network to consider our device as the router ( we \u0026ldquo;spoof\u0026rdquo; the original router/switch address in some way ):\nOnce this happens, all of the network traffic goes through your computer instead of the legit router/switch and at that point you can do pretty much everything you want, from just sniffing for specific data ( emails, passwords, cookies, etc of other people on your network ) to actively intercepting and proxying all the requests of some specific protocol in order to modify them on the fly ( you can, for instance, replace all images of all websites being visited by everyone, kill connections, etc ).\n"
